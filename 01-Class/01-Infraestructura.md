# Features and adventages of Cloud Computing

## What is Cloud Computing?

it is a model for the delivery and consumption of services on demand.
<b>what services?</b> computing power, storage, databases, applications, and other IT resources, offered through a platform accessible via the nerwork with pay-per-use precing, meaning you don't need to invest in hardware and storage. Instead, you can provision the type and size of computing resource you need for your solutin. Yu can quickly access as many resources as you need, without contracts, and you only pay for what you consume.

## What is Cloud Computing used for?

The usefulness of cloud computring is extensive and variable. With any service you use, you are guaranteed agility and can focus more on developing the company's operations or projects that aare truly important to the institution's business. Below, i will discuss some use cases.

## Implement any application

I asy any applications because there are no restricctions; basically, the capacity is unlimited. Artificial intelligence, web applications, mobile applicaiton, Big Data, etc .Normally, new companies opt to implement their infraestructure in the cloud from the uoutset, and those that have their data center locally are mostly migrating ot the cloud.

## Development Software

Develpment environments identical to production are creaed to avoid encountering errors when moving to production. There is also a model called PaaS (Platform as a Service) that makes life easier for developers and is widely used. In this model, they only have to worry about the application code; everything else is the provider's responsibility.

## Collaborate between teams

This group includes solutions that enable seamless colaboration in work teams. Examples include email services, videoconferencing environments, repositories, and shared storage for working on files that can be modified by more than one person in real time.

## Back up information

Some users and companiesuse the cloud to store backups of their data. In some cases, a hybrid between local infraestucture and the cloud ennvironment is used.

## Features of Cloud Computing

According to NIST (National Institute for Standars and Technology), these are the main characteristics of cloud computing:

<b>On-demand self-service:</b> This is a service that is available automatically and on demand, meaning that you can provision and manage resources when you need them, without the intervention of the provider.

<b>Accesible via the network:</b> Resources must be aviable ont he network, regardless of the type of cloud. The service can be on a private network or publicly accesible via the internet.

<b>Elasticity:</b> This goes a little beyond the concept of scalability as we traditionally know. It refers to the ability to grow infraestructure and resource as needed, and likewise reduce them, freeing up resources that are no longer required.

<b>Metered service and pay-per-use:</b> Resource usage is monitored, controllerm and reportedm providing a level of transparency. There are different types of measurement, storage, bandwith, activity time (hours, minutes, seconds), etc,. in any case, only the resources used are billed, no more, no less.

# Advantages and desadventages of Cloud Computing

Like any technologies and service, there are many benefits to cloud computing, but also drawbacks. Below, i will mention the advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing, focusing more on the public cloud (the types of cloud are discussed in another article).

## Adventages of cloud Computing

### Agility

This is one of the main advantages of cloud computing. Resoruces are literally just a click away. Environments that previously took days to become available can now be made available to developersd in matter of minutes. This has a tremendous impact ob bussinesses, as they can focus on their business ideas and implement them more quickly.


### No large initial investments

Capital expenditures (CapEx) are replaced by operaing expenditures (OpEx). You no longer have to think about making large investments to purchase servers and maintain data centers, instead, you can set up your infraestructure in the cloud and pay only for what you use, which is why these are variable operating expenses.

### No contractual obligations

There are no long-term commitments, as I have been repeating, there is a py-per-use pricing model. Many providers charge by the hours, so you can implement prohects and, if you don't like something, you canbacck out whithout any problems. The agility of IT operations increases considerably because it reduces or eliminates the bureaucracy that exists in many intitutions, where you have to go  through a series of steps and review to get approval to purchase an asset.

### Unlimited, elastic, and urestricted capacity

When we want to deploy an application, we face a decision: define the computing capacity for that applicaiton, where wecan either exceed our needs and not use allthe resources, or fall short and have to deal with limited capacity. With cloud computing, we can forget about these guesswork scenarios. We can access as much or as little capacity as we need, and scale up and down quickly according to demand.

### Benefits from economies of scale.

It's simple, if the provider does well, customers benefit. When hundreds of thousands of new customers use the service, the provider achieves greater economies of scale, which means that variable costs can be lower than normal in other words, lower pay-per-use prices.

### Global infraestructure

You can deploy your application in any region or in several regions, bringing you closer to your custmers, providing lower latency, and, consequently, a better user experience. Most surprisingly, all this can be done is a matter of minutes. It also provides high availability, allowing you to recover wuickly from feilures or disasters. With a well-designed and automated architecture, the end user will not even notice the change or interruption in server. As you learn and practice, you will discover a number of important benefits that you cannot achieve when you maintain your own infraestructure.


## Disadventages of Cloud Computing

Based on what you have read so far, you may be wondering, <b>what are the advantages?</b> Cloud Computing does not seem to have any disadventages, I will mention a few that we can consider.

### You need a stable internet connection

It's true that being able to access it from anywhere is an advantage, but it's also true that you depend on your internet connection. In a way, there is a point of failure; if there is a problem with your ISP or internet privder, you're stuck, even if the cloud service is available.


### Depends on the security of a third party

In terms of security, there is a shared responsibility model, so part of it must be entrusted to the provider. However, I justify this by saying that the provider abviously has better technlogy than we con acquire. I see this more as a drawback in some cases when proposing a migation to the cloud, as persuading someone who is distrustful and unwiling to change is quite a challenge.

### How Cloud Computing Works

When we say “the data is in the cloud,” where is the data really located? It is in physical data centers managed by the provider. Obviously, there is a set of technologies involved in maintaining and delivering the cloud computing service, but we will not go into detail. What we are going to explain is the model.
The first thing we need to be clear about is that there is a service provider (cloud provider) and a consumer (customer). I will explain this with an example to make it easier to understand. I am the customer. I need computing resources to launch my company's projects, deploy some applications, use an email service, and implement a development environment. Well, I don't have those resources available, and my company is not able to produce them on its own, so I have to find a provider, in this case a public cloud provider such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
These providers guarantee the features mentioned above. First, fast and immediate access to the resources I need for my solutions, usually through a web browser. Ultimately, the medium and device I use is not the most interesting thing; what matters is that I will interact with the platform directly and consume the service without the provider's intervention.
After implementation, I need it to adjust to demand. For example, if we need more storage, we need to be able to scale up without any problems. If an application has high seasonal demand peaks, the infrastructure must be able to scale up and handle that demand for resources, and scale down when demand decreases. Furthermore, I want all of this to be automatic. Another key aspect is that it has to be pay-as-you-go; I pay according to my consumption of the service.
